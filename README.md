## Test Automation - Selenium

This project is an example of web test automation using Page Object Modeling (POM).

## Test subject

The website we used: https://www.asos.com/
This website is an online shopping website for both men's and women's clothes. It has many features to use for this example of web test automation, so we chose it.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources, pages and tests
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Libraries and frameworks

 - Selenium - web automation
 - Maven - Build and package management

## Tools

 - We used Visual Studio Code to make and edit our files. But of course, others are also possible.
 
## Programming language

 - We used Java programming language to code, because it is easy to use and although it's possible to automate testing for iOS, Android and Web platforms.
